/opt/vc/bin/tvservice -p
/opt/vc/bin/tvservice -o
Then to turn it back on, a different script runs:
/opt/vc/bin/tvservice -p
sudo chvt 6;sudo chvt 7
And the script I'm using for a Screensaver does utilize feh. But feh doesn't handle the timeout and everything, just runs the slideshow. This is the script I'm executing for the screensaver:
